# blockchain-webpage
block-chain based decentralized blog web page

## this is python blockchain code with adding new data with mining each block. Simple...
## this is then connected with web page to make it interactice and fun to understand
## so it is basically decentralized web app (in purpose of blog)

## Hosting it and running python file will keep running site, so when someone adds to blog it wont store anywhere. But everyone can still see it.
## So it is beauty of decentralized.
